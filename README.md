# BetterDesignCharacterBuilder 
I previously made a character builder for a custom tabletop game a buddy and I were writing a campaign for, however I realized about 2/3 of the way through the project that I had made some pretty serious design flaws that would keep me from being able to finish it (at least at my current skill level).  I wasn't sure at the beginning if I wanted to connect to a database or have everything reset per session for the web app but somehow I think it will be easier to actually record each user's built character. Soooo I am rewriting the project doing smaller pieces at a time with better design practices using JPA and database connectivity.
